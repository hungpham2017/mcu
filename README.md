# Modeling and Crystallographic Utilities (mcu)
MCU is a comprehensive package for the analysis of periodic wavefunctions and crystallography. It is specifically designed to facilitate large-scale analysis and provide topological descriptions for periodic wavefunctions.

# Installation

```
conda install -c hqp mcu
```

## Features:
- MCU provides support for various major periodic electronic structure codes, including [VASP](https://www.vasp.at/), [Quantum Espresso](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/), [CRYSTAL](https://www.crystal.unito.it/), [CP2K](https://www.cp2k.org/), and [Wannier90](http://www.wannier.org/).
- It offers a flexible syntax for orbital selection, making it easy to plot projected band structures and density of states (DOS).
- MCU also provides a convenient method for selecting orbitals and generating input (d3) files for CRYSTAL calculations. Projected DOS analysis using CRYSTAL has never been easier.
